Amazingly, SeeYou works just as well with an external sensor as the Bräuniger Compeo+. I read barometric data about 12 times per second to smooth it, but I only send it twice per second.
Here’s a video: Unfortunately, the Omni screen is too bright, but the phone and the Compeo+ can be compared well. I also find the acoustics quite good.
